This is the repository containing the code for the thesis: "Optimizing Convolutions for GPU execution in Futhark"
The code is largely split up in 2 parts, the CUDA code and the Futhark code.
The CUDA code contains makefiles for running and testing the code. 
The Futhark code contains makefiles for creating data sets. To benchmark the code, use futhark bench.
